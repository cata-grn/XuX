XUX NETWORK CORE - MICRO-TRANSACTION GAS PRICING LIMIT CONFIGURATION v1.1
===============================================================================
SYSTEM ARCHITECT & PROTOCOL ENGINEER: R.C.F.
ROUTING MANAGEMENT: Serverless Surcharge Threshold Ceiling Locks
VALIDATION OBJECTIVE: Anti-Gouging Fixed Execution Surcharge Hardchecks

## SECTION 1: HARD-CAPPED FEE CEILINGS & BITWISE THRESHOLDS
To guarantee predictable enterprise operating expenses across the 26 industrial sectors, 
the matrix ledger enforces strict upper boundary limits on computational fees:
- BASE MICRO-FEE STANDARD : Locked natively at a flat rate of 0.05% per execution volume.
- ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM CEILING: Hard-capped via bitwise constraints at 0.10% total volume. 
  The system rejects any dynamic congestion multiplier breaching this barrier.
- Asset Track Floor Isolation: Fiat (GBP, EUR, USD) and utility token (AET) channels 
  discard incoming transactions failing local network fee validation passes.

## SECTION 2: FAIL-SECURE THROTTLING & CONGESTION DEVIATION LOOPS
- Congestion Ceiling Enforcement: If workload spikes push node requests past 50,000 TPS, 
  the dynamic fee optimizer stops scaling at the 0.10% absolute hardcheck wall.
- System Reaction: Inbound transactions presenting fee configurations matching or exceeding 
  the 0.11% threshold trigger an immediate execution error, aborting data processing 
  and rolling back database rows automatically within 400 milliseconds.
- Automated Supply Combustion: The 50% fee extraction loop continues to burn half of all 
  captured transaction fees to the null address `xux_vault_0000000000000000000_burn`.

## SECTION 3: IMMUTABLE SHIELD OVERRIDES & VETO PRIVILEGES
- Modifying hardcoded pricing limits, altering bitwise ceilings, or white-listing specific 
  high-volume channels requires a digital signature verification match from the unalterable 
  SHA-3_512 master configuration key vector belonging exclusively to R.C.F.
- Any unapproved administrative challenge or configuration bypass attempt executed by 
  incoming investors trips the internal core_config.py validation loop, triggering 
  an immediate global network freeze within 24 hours.

## SECTION 4: LOCAL CACHE FILTER STAGING BOUNDARIES
- Gas limit profiling run logs, transaction simulation variables, and local developer 
  environment variable parameters are completely filtered from push trees via active repository .gitignore rules.
